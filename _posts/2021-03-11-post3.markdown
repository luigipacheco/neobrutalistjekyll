8 cubed is a collection of animated tiny 8x8x8 voxel worlds. This is an experiment to understand and test the NFT's and how to interact with some platforms and marketplaces.

### Comments

Gas fees (gwei) seem to be too expensive and volatile.
This site [RARIBLE TOOLS](https://tools.gravityenterprises.co.za/#/Cost) seems to be the best way to predict them if posting on rarible(they are very dinamic). Also check the differences from ERC 721 and ERC 1155. Seems like the later will be a better standard for the future.
