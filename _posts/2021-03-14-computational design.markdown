In this blog post, I'm excited to share a series of YouTube tutorials focused on computational design. These tutorials are designed for beginners and enthusiasts alike, aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of computational design using Blender, Sverchok, and Python.

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Computational Design

In the first chapter, we dive into the basics of Blender's interface, tailored for computational design applications. The goal is to get you acquainted with Sverchok and Python, focusing on:

- Basic data structures and manipulation of simple geometry.
- Understanding vertex and edge creation.
- Getting started with Python programming, particularly in the context of computational design.

### Chapter 2: Surfaces and Mathematics

The second chapter takes a more in-depth look at creating surfaces using mathematical concepts. Inspired by Joseph Choma's book, this chapter covers:

- Describing, creating, and modifying geometry through mathematical formulas in Python.
- Understanding the differences between NURBS and MESH modeling.
- Practical applications of these concepts using Blender's Sverchok addon.

### Chapter 3: To Be Announced

Stay tuned for the third chapter, where we will explore more advanced concepts and techniques in computational design.
