Series of you tube tutorials in computational design.

### Chapter 1 Introduction to computational design

The first chapter's goal is to understand the basics of Blender's interface for computational design with Sverchok and Python. Understand the basic data structures to manipulate simple geometry and learn the basics of Python programming. Mostly the chapter deals with vertex and edge creation and Python basic programming.

### Chapter 2 Surfaces and Math

Second chapter focuses in making surfaces with math (Inspired by Joseph Choma Book) and deals with describing, creating and modifying geometry with mathematical formulas in Python. Understand the difference between NURBS and MESH modeling and how to use them in Blender's Sverchok addon.

### Chapter 3 TBA
