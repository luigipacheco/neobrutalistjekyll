## TARGETED RANDOM BRANCH GROWTH ALGORITHM (IAAC student project)


This project was designed for the first term in the Master in Robotics and Advanced Construction in IAAC, to explore an alternative to current support structures in 3D printing.

- Developed in Python  for Grasshopper
- Three dimensional branching
- Self-collition avoidance.
