## 3D Printed Espresso Cups

In the fascinating world of digital fabrication, the convergence of craft and technology brings about a unique creation: **3D printed espresso cups**. These cups look at creating a functional design but also a showcase of the artistic potential of parametric design in clay.

Utilizing Blender's Sverchok, an advanced node-based geometry tool, each espresso cup is crafted with a unique "fungerprint" . The spirilized layering technique developed for a continuos line that exposes the nature of the fabrication process.

Sverchok allows for a parametric design approach, enabling the creation of complex forms that are both functional and artistic. The process involves developing the toolpath for the base to create a watertight object, followed by a spiralized contour that generates the cup, texturing is used to custumize each cup to be unique.

These espresso cups made with  modern digital tools and traditional materials, offer a glimpse into the future of daily objects and technlogy. They are not just vessels for coffee but are also artifacts made from digital craftsmanship.
