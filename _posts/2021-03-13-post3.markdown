As a long time fan of Dune's Universe I am making a collection of NFT's  inspired by it. Most of the aesthetics follow Jodorowsky's Dune sketches by [Moebius](https://www.heavymetal.com/news/moebius-concept-art-jodorowsky-dune-characters/) and [H.R. Giger](https://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/hr-giger) rethought on a an even more grothesque way. New assets will be created as the last one is sold.

### 001 The Baron 

One of my favorite characters, he's the main anthagonist on the original Dune Book. Smart , wicked and ugly. 

Vladimir  Harkonnen, Siridar of planet Giedi Prime and house Harkonnen. So fat he needs suspensors anchored to his skin to move.
