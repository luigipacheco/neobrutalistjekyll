As a longtime fan of the Dune universe, I am excited to present a collection of NFTs inspired by this iconic sci-fi saga. My work predominantly draws inspiration from Jodorowsky's unmade film adaptation of Dune, particularly the sketches by [Moebius](https://www.heavymetal.com/news/moebius-concept-art-jodorowsky-dune-characters/) and [H.R. Giger](https://www.duneinfo.com/unseen/hr-giger). I've reimagined these concepts in an even more grotesque and fascinating manner. New assets in this collection will be created and released as the last one is sold.

### 001 The Baron

One of my favorite characters from the original Dune book is the main antagonist, Vladimir Harkonnen. He is a character of intelligence, malevolence, and distinctive physicality.

*Vladimir Harkonnen, Siridar of planet Giedi Prime and house Harkonnen, is depicted in this piece. Due to his immense weight, he requires suspensors anchored to his skin to move.*

This NFT piece started as a 3D scanned model of a Fat Buddha sculpture. It was then digitally modified, sculpted, and painted to match the character's unique attributes. The combination of traditional sculpture and digital artistry creates a piece that is both haunting and captivating.
