For the Neon 2021 Art Festival in Norfolk, Virginia, I created an interactive tool using P5.js. This tool enables the creation of abstract images through a (biased) random walking dot algorithm. It's an exploration of how simple rules in computational design can lead to complex and aesthetically pleasing outcomes.

### Interactive Generative Art

The tool is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. By adjusting various sliders, you can control aspects like the dot's movement, color palette, and trail effects, allowing for a vast range of artistic expressions. The aim is to make the process of creating abstract art both accessible and engaging, even for those without a background in programming or design.

### Try It Yourself

I encourage you to experiment with the tool and see what unique patterns and designs you can create. Feel free to share your creations or thoughts on how the tool could be further enhanced for artistic exploration.

### Behind the Scenes

This tool was developed using P5.js, a JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. The random walking dot algorithm is a classic example of generative art, where simple rules can lead to unexpectedly intricate patterns. The 'bias' in the random walk introduces a degree of predictability, adding another layer of complexity to the artwork.

### Reflection

Creating this tool for the Neon 2021 Art Festival was not only a technical challenge but also a deeply artistic endeavor. It underscores the power of computational design in expanding the boundaries of traditional art forms and offers a glimpse into the vast potential of interactive and generative art.
