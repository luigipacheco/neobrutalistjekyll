In the world of digital fabrication, the blend of traditional materials and modern technology often leads to breathtaking creations. **Coded Clay** is a perfect example of this fusion of art, mathematics, and technology.

These objects are not just ordinary pottery items; they represent the intersection of parametric design and digital fabrication. Utilizing Blender, a powerful 3D modeling software, along with Python scripting, each cup is crafted with precision and artistic flair. This technique draws inspiration from Joseph Choma's book "Morphing," which explores the transformative power of design.

The process involves designing surfaces with seamless layering, resulting in a unique, textured appearance that stems from the 3D printing process. This project required the use of a customized CNC machine, specifically adapted for clay printing. This adaptation explores repurposing a CNC machine for pottery.
