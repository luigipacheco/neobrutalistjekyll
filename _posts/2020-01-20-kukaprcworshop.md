## Syllabus
Creative Robotics workshops aim to investigate the state-of-the-art application of robotics at various scales from the urban fabric right down on-site construction medthods. With the adaptation of robotics in architecture & other creative industries, there is access to new opportunities through the application of these emergent technologies within design, fabrication and construction that has the potential to challenge traditional means. Over the course of our workshops the primary goal is to explore the adaptation of these synchronous technologies as they relate to existing workflows and applications of physicalising the digital, to generate new and exciting approaches to the built environment.


## Learning Objectives

Students will be introduced to emergent technologies and methodologies such as parametric design and control of a KUKA industrial robotic arm using tools such Rhino, Grasshopper & KUKA|prc. Key concepts introduced will be the workflow involved with integrating automation and robotics within a creative environment for rapid prototyping & new fabrication methods. Students will walk away with fundamental knowledge of Rhino, Grasshopper & KUKA/prc. They will be prepared to conceptualize, program and run robotic programs through the software and ideas raised over the intensive five day workshop. This includes the creation, exportation and running of KUKA Robot Language (KRL) via parametric modelling tools.

## TUTORS

### Karl Singline
Karl Singline is a graduate architect and roboticist from Australia. After graduating from the University of Tasmania with a Master of Architecture, where he played a key role in integrating a KUKA robotic arm into the curriculum for both the school of architecture as well as other faculties and community groups, he launched his popular YouTube channel with over 100,000 views, specializing in tutorials on visual programming and robotics. He has travelled the world delivering cutting-edge workshops specialising in introducing the core concepts of thinking robotically, visual programming and developing processes to physicalize the digital through the real-world application of robotics. As a full-time researcher within Creative Robotics, Karl works on personal research as well as partnering with external industry partners to further explore new ways of adapting robotic technologies to architecture and other creative industries.

### Andres Gonzales Posada

Andres is a software trainer and developer since the 1980s. He has developed applications for diverse esign markets as well as training materials for different CAD and design software products including AEC Metric PRO, Mepal Draw, and the Integrator (BIM) for AutoCAD (2010-2014), as well as the community of training materials www.rhino3d.tv for Rhinoceros®. Andres has been working with the Rhinoceros® team since the very early stages; he is now the head of the McNeel Southeast US & Latin American Division. He also serves as the worldwide director of the Computational Design and Fabrication community called RhinoFabStudio® , in addition to the Generative Jewelry & Fashion Design community GJD3D , and Generative Furniture Design community GFD3D . Andres has written numerous multimedia learning products for Rhinoceros®, Flamingo, Grasshopper, RhinoCAM, etc. His latest work is related to a card game, Sudohopper3D, which draws on fundamental thinking processes to interactively learn generative and computational design.

### Luis Pacheco
Luis Pacheco is a graduate architect from University of La Salle Bajío México with a master in Robotics and Advanced Construction from the Institute of Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC), co-founder of MakerMex first Mexican 3D printer manufacturing company and recognized as MIT's Innovators under 35 Mexico 2016.
