In this post, I explore the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and architecture. By leveraging various AI tools, I aim to sketch and conceptualize innovative architectural designs, showcasing how AI can augment the creative process in architecture.

### 3D Printed Architecture Ideas

The following images represent concepts for 3D printed structures, emphasizing unique forms and functional designs that are achievable through digital fabrication techniques.

### Babel Library Concept

This section is dedicated to my conceptual designs for a futuristic library, inspired by the mythic Tower of Babel. These designs blend traditional architectural elements with avant-garde AI-driven aesthetics.
