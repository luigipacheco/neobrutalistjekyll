### Neobrutal Chess: A Crowdfunded Design Statement

The Neobrutal chess set features a simple yet striking design, making it an ideal decorative piece for a studio, living room, or office. It embodies the principles of Brutalism, focusing on materiality, texture, and a monolithic appearance. The creation of this unique chess set was made possible through the enthusiastic backing of supporters on Kickstarter.
